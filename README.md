# Pocketbase OAuth2 Demo (Sign-in with Google)

Quick and practical demo of doing OAuth2 on Pocketbase. This demo will use Google OAuth2 infrastructure to create "Sign-in with Google" functionality and use Pocketbase as database to store the user data when succesfully signed-in with Google.

## Technical notes

- I already have setup Pocketbase infrastructure in https://api.buka.sh/v2
