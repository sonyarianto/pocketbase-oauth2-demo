# Pocketbase OAuth2 Demo (Sign-in with Google)

Quick and practical demo of doing OAuth2 on Pocketbase. This demo will use Google OAuth2 infrastructure to create "Sign-in with Google" functionality and use Pocketbase as database to store the user data when succesfully signed-in with Google.

## Technical notes

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- I already have setup Pocketbase infrastructure in https://api.buka.sh/v2. Want to setup nice Pocketbase infra on your system? Just contact me for consultation.
- I already create Google credential for this demo. You can create one at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials.
- The main code to do that is on `https://github.com/sonyarianto/pocketbase-oauth2-demo/blob/main/src/App.svelte`.
